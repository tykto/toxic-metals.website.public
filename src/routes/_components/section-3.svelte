                Everybody has heavy toxic metals in their body, they are in our daily environment and over time they can accumulate in the body causing serious
                chronic illnesses.
              </p>
              <p>Today it is not a question of whether or not you have been exposed to heavy metals, but rather by which ones and by how much.</p>
